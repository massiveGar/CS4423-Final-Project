  dialogue:
  - 'Hey you! I could use some help - Slimes have overtaken my shop! '
  - Clearly, I'm too injured to fight. I assume you have some experience using rings?
  - What!? You've never used a ring before? That's okay - it's really easy!
  - Here, take this Slash ring, if you choose a target with (Q), you can get close,
    use the ring, and watch what happens!
  - If you can kill the three slimes overtaking my shop, I can sell you some more
    rings!
